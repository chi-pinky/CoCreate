# CoCreate - Week 2 Assignments

This repository contains Python solutions for foundational programming assignments, focused on iteration, user input, and basic logic.

---

## Assignment 1: Sum of Numbers
This assignment demonstrates how to sum a list of numbers using a `for` loop. The program iterates through a predefined list and accumulates the total, showcasing basic list handling and arithmetic operations.

**Features:**
- Iterates over a list of numbers.
- Calculates and prints the sum of all the numbers.

**How to Run**
```bash
python assignment1.py
```

## Assignment 2: Number Guessing Game
This assignment is a simple guessing game. The program selects a secret number and gives the user a limited number of attempts to guess it. The user is prompted for guesses, and the program provides feedback after each attempt.

**Features:**
- Uses a `while` loop to manage the number of guesses.
- Accepts user input and checks it against a secret number.
- Provides winning and losing feedback.

**How to Run**
```bash
python assignment2.py
```

## Assignment 3: List Manipulation and Name Input
This assignment includes two interactive tasks:
1. **Dynamic List and Sum:** Users enter numbers repeatedly, which are inserted at the start of a list. The sum is updated each time. The loop exits when a negative number is entered.
2. **Name Entry Loop:** Users are prompted to enter names until "END" is typed, after which the program ends.

**Features:**
- Demonstrates infinite loops with break conditions.
- Shows list operations (insert at beginning) and running totals.
- Handles string input termination.

**How to Run**
```bash
python assignment3.py
```
