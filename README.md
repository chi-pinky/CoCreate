# CoCreate
This repository contains Python programs for practicing basic programming concepts. Below are the lab work exercises included:

# Lab Work 1: Conditional Statements
The program takes an integer input n and performs the following actions:

If n is odd, it prints Weird.
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, it prints Not Weird.
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, it prints Weird.
If n is even and greater than 20, it prints Not Weird.


# Lab Work 2: House Downpayment Calculator
This program calculates the downpayment for a house based on the user's budget and the following rules:

If the house price is between $300,000 and $500,000 (inclusive), the downpayment is 10% of the budgeted amount.
If the house price is above $500,000, the downpayment is 20% of the budgeted amount.
The formula for calculating the downpayment is:

Code
downpayment = (percentage / 100) * budgeted_price



# Lab Work 3: Quiz Game
This program is a simple quiz game where:
The user is asked a series of questions.
The program checks if the user's answers match the correct answers.
Based on the user's responses, feedback is provided.
